# Upperworker
> <sup> (less than a min read) </sup>

**Upperworker** is a website inspired by the famous Yelp app, but instead of reviewing and advertising new spaces, it's meant to share, offer, and review people's work.
A space where people can share their experience and knowledge, no matter the size, be it manual or virtual works, a place to provide the necessary exposure to those 
small entrepreneurs and personal businesses where each one can contribute and offer the value they deem necessary and get closer to the people who really need the job.

This project was built following the YelpCamp project done by Professor Colt Steele in his web development bootcamp course,
but in my way of putting a different spin on the result of the project, I decided to change the scope of the website to a space where people's work can be shared and reviewed.
